- A Microbit [Microbit store](https://microbit.org/buy)
- An ESP-12F (I used an [Elecfreaks IoT bit](https://shop.elecfreaks.com/products/elecfreaks-iot-bit-internet-wifi-extension-board-for-micro-bit?_pos=2&_sid=2513e1df0&_ss=r)) simply because it is a lot simpler than working with just an ESP-8266(it would be great if somebody tried, I'm sure it's possible; [Microbit IoT in C](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/_/oSFfvgAACAAJ?hl=en))
- Another, completely optional, is a [Kitronik OLED screen](https://kitronik.co.uk/products/56115-kitronik-view-graphics128-oled-display-128x64-for-bbc-micro-bit?_pos=1&_sid=6c94b0b1b&_ss=r) to help with displaying data, rather than a 5 x 5 led matrix
